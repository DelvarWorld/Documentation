#Solid Particle System (SPS)

## Introduction

The SPS is a single updatable mesh. The solid particles are simply separate parts or faces fo this big mesh.  
As it is just a mesh, the SPS has all the same properties than any other BJS mesh : not more, not less. It can be scaled, rotated, translated, enlighted, textured, moved, etc.  

The SPS is also a particle system. It provides some methods to manage the particles.  
However it is behavior agnostic. This means it has no emitter, no particle physics, no particle recycler. You have to implement your own behavior.  

The particles can be built from any BJS existing mesh as a model. Actually, each particle is a copy of some BJS mesh geometry : vertices, indices, uvs.    

The expected usage if this one :  
* First, create your SPS with `new SolidParticleSystem()`.  
* Then, add particles in the SPS from a mesh model with `addShape(model, number)`.  
* Redo this as many times as needed with any model.  
* When done, build the SPS mesh with `buildMesh()`.   

Your SPS is then ready to manage particles. So now :   
* Init all your particles : set their positions, colors, uvs, age, etc with `initParticles()`  
* Call `setParticles()` to update the SPS mesh and to draw it.  
* If you particles have to be animated, define their individual behavior in `updateParticle(particle)` and just call `setParticles()` within the render loop.  


## Basic Usage

### SPS Creation
First you create an empty SPS and you add particles to it with the _addShape(mesh, nb)_ method as many times you need.  
The SPS name will be its underlying mesh name.   


Then you build the mesh.  
Example :
```javascript
var SPS = new SolidParticleSystem("SPS", scene);
var sphere = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateSphere("s", {}, scene);
var poly = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreatePolyhedron("p", {type: 2}, scene);
SPS.addShape(sphere, 20);      // 20 spheres
SPS.addShape(poly, 120);       // 120 polyhedrons 
SPS.addShape(sphere, 80);      // 80 other spheres
sphere.dispose();
poly.dispose();

var mesh = SPS.buildMesh();  // finally builds and displays the real mesh
```
Now your SPS is visible as it is just built.  
If just want to create immutable things (not moving, not rotating, not changing their colors, etc) set somewhere in your scene, you would probably stop here.  

However the SPS is ready to get a behavior.  
Once the behavior will be given (or not), you actually display the particles at their current updated positions with current properties with :
```javascript
SPS.billboard = true; // or false by default
SPS.setParticles();
```
`SPS.billboard` is a boolean (default _false_). If set to _true_, all the particles will face the cam and their _x_ and _y_ rotation values will be ignored. This is rather useful if you display only plane particles.  
You need to call `SPS.setParticles()` within the `scene.registerBeforeRender()` function in order to display the SPS in billboard mode.   
Here is an example with plane particles in billboard mode : http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#WCDZS  
The same but with plane particle rotations and no billboard mode : http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#WCDZS#1  
The same with solid particles, boxes and tetrahedrons : http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#WCDZS#2  


### Particle Management

The `setParticles()` function can be used in the BJS render loop.  
It is mandatory to use this function to update and display the mesh.  

You can give your SPS a behavior by setting some custom functions :  

* **`initParticles()`** : lets you set all the initial particle properties. You must iterate over all the particles by using the `SPS.nbParticles` property. The usage of this function is not mandatory.
* **`recycleParticle(particle)`** : lets you set a particle to be recycled. It is called per particle. The usage of this function is not mandatory. 
* **`updateParticle(particle)`** : lets you set the particle properties. This function is called per particle by `SPS.setParticles()`. The usage of this function is not mandatory.  
* **`beforeUpdateParticles()`** : lets you make things within the call to `SPS.setParticles()` just before iterating over all the particles.  The usage of this function is not mandatory.   
* **`afterUpdateParticles()`** : lets you make things within the call to `SPS.setParticles()`  just after the iteration over all the particles is done. The usage of this function is not mandatory.   
* 
So to better understand how it works, here is a pseudo-code schema :
```javascript
var particles: SolidParticles[] = [array of SolidParticle objects];
function setParticles() {
  beforeUpdateParticles();                 // custom function
  for (var p = 0; p < nbParticles; p++) {
    updateParticles(particles[p]);         // custom function
  }
  updateTheWholeMesh();                   // does the WebGL work
  afterUpdateParticles();                 // custom function
}
```
So you could call `recycleParticle(particle)` in your own `updateParticle(particle)Ã¨ function for instance :
```javascript
SPS.updateParticle = function(particle) {
  particle.velocity--;
  if (particle.velocity < 0) {
    particle.alive = false;
    SPS.recycleParticle(particle);    // call to your own recycle function
    }
}
```

The particle properties that can be set are :

* **`position`** : Vector3  default = (0, 0, 0)
* **`rotation`** : Vector3  default = (0, 0, 0)  
* **`quaternion`** : Vector3  default = undefined
* **`velocity`** : Vector3  default = (0, 0, 0)
* **`color`** : Vector4  default = (1, 1, 1, 1)
* **`scale`** : Vector3  default = (1, 1, 1)
* **`uvs`** : Vector(4) default = (0,0, 1,1)
* **`alive`** : boolean  default = true

If you set a particle rotation quaternion, its rotation property will then be ignored.    
If you set your SPS in billboard mode, you should only set a `rotation.z` value.   

Please note that all positions are expressed in the mesh **local space** and not in the World space.  

You can obviously also create your own properties like _acceleration: Vector3_ or _age_, in `initParticles()` for instance.  
```javascript
SPS.initParticles = function() {
  for (var p = 0; p < SPS.nbParticles; p++) {
    particles[p].age = Math.random() * 20;
  }
}
```
You may also access to some read-only properties :   

* **`idx`** : particle index
* **`shapeId`** : shape model ID

Actually each time you call the `SPS.addShape()` method, the related newly created particle set shapeID is returned.
```javascript
var plane = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreatePlane("", {}, scene);
var quadsID = SPS.addShape(plane, 20);
```
This is usefull if you want to apply a given behavior to some particle types only.   
<br/>

## SPS Management
You have access to some SPS properties :

* **`SPS.particles`** : this is the array containing all the particles. You should iterate over this array in `initParticles()` function for instance.
* **`SPS.nbParticles`** : this is number of particles in the SPS.
* **`SPS.counter`** : this is a counter for your own usage. It's not set by any SPS default functions.

Here again, you can add your own properties like _capacity_ or _rate_ if needed.

If you don't need some given features (ex : particle colors), you can disable/enable them at any time (disabling a feature will improve the performance) : 
```javascript
SPS.computeParticleRotation = false;       // prevents from computing particle.rotation
SPS.computeParticleTexture = false;        // prevents from computing particle.uvs
SPS.computeParticleColor = false;          // prevents from computing particle.color
SPS.computeParticleVertex = false;         // prevents from calling the custom updateParticleVertex() function
```
All these properties, except `SPS.computeParticleVertex`, are enabled set to _true_ by default. These affect the `SPS.setParticles()` process only.   
If these properties are set to _false_, they don't prevent from using the related feature (ie : the particles can still have a color even if `SPS.computeParticleColor` is set to _false_), they just prevent from updating the value of the particle property on the next `setParticle()` call.  
Example : if your particles have colors, you can set their colors wihtin the `initParticles()` call and you can call then once the `setParticles()` method to set these colors. If you need to animate them later on and these colors don't change, just set then `SPS.computeParticleColor` to _false_ once before runing the render loop which will call `setParticles()` each frame.  
If you are familiar with how BJS works, you could compare the SPS and its mesh creation to some classical BJS mesh creation (vertex and indice settings) and the particle management to the World Matrix computation (rotation, scaling, positioning).  

Note you can also use the standard BJS mesh _freezeXXX()_ methods if the SPS mesh is immobile or if the normals aren't needed :   
```javascript
SPS.mesh.freezeWorldMatrix();       // prevents from re-computing the World Matrix each frame
SPS.mesh.freezeNormals();           // prevents from re-computing the normals each frame
```

If you don't need your SPS any longer, you can dispose it to free the memory
```javascript
SPS.dispose();
SPS = null    // tells the GC the reference can be cleaned up also
```

Example :

```javascript
 var cube = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox("b", {}, scene);
 // Particle system
  var speed = 2;
  var gravity = -0.01;
  var SPS = new SolidParticleSystem('SPS', scene);
  SPS.addShape(cube, 1000);
  var mesh = SPS.buildMesh();
  mesh.freezeWorldMatrix();
  cube.dispose();


  // define a custom SPS behavior

  SPS.initParticles = function() {
    // just recycle everything
    for (var p = 0; p < this.nbParticles; p++) {
      this.recycleParticle(this.particles[p]);
    }
  };

  SPS.recycleParticle = function(particle) {
    // set particle new velocity, scale and rotation
    particle.position = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();  
    particle.velocity = (new BABYLON.Vector3(Math.random() - 0.5, Math.random(), Math.random() - 0.5)).scaleInPlace(speed);
    particle.scale = (new BABYLON.Vector3(1, 1, 1)).scaleInPlace(Math.random() * 3 + 1);
    particle.rotation = (new BABYLON.Vector3(Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random())).scaleInPlace(0.1);
    particle.color = new BABYLON.Color4(Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random());
  };

  SPS.updateParticle = function(particle) {
  if (particle.position.y < 0) {
      this.recycleParticle(particle);
    }
    particle.velocity.y += gravity;                         // apply gravity to y
    (particle.position).addInPlace(particle.velocity);      // update particle new position
    particle.position.y += speed / 2;
    var sign = (particle.idx % 2 == 0) ? 1 : -1;            // rotation sign and new value
    particle.rotation.z += 0.1 * sign;
    particle.rotation.x += 0.05 * sign;
    particle.rotation.y += 0.008 * sign;
  };

  // Main Program
  // ============

  // init all particle values
  SPS.initParticles();

  // animate the SPS
  scene.registerBeforeRender(function() {
    SPS.setParticles();
  });
  ```
### Summary
The SPS is behavior-agnostic. This means it doesn't know how the particles will move, rotate, if they have a mass, if there are forces, etc. You have to see it like a big mesh that you can create (`buildMesh`) from many shape models, some BJS existing meshes, (`addShape`) that will be its solid particles. It provides some methods to access then and to manage these solid particles.  

So the initial stuff to do is to create the SPS, then to add as many shapes you need and at last to build the SPS mesh.  

Once you've done it, you need to manage your solid particles.

The way to fix the particle status and then to display them at this status is to call `SPS.setParticles()`.  
Each time you call `setParticles()` the particles are rendered at their current status. Easy, isn't it ?

So three steps :

  * SPS and its mesh creation
  * compute your particle behavior
  * call setParticles() to update the mesh and draw it

Just remember that, once the mesh is build, only **`setParticles()`** does then the job : updates the mesh VBO and draws it.

To help you to update each particle status, `setParticle()` will call for each particle `SPS.updateParticle(particle)`.  
This function doesn't do anything by default, so it is the place were you can implement your particle behavior, with physics if you want. It is passed each particle object in turn, which you can set its initial properties (position, rotation, quaternion, scale, color, uvs, velocity) or add and set your own if your logic needs it (age ? mass ? etc).  
So `updateParticle()` just changes the particle data, not the mesh itself. The `setParticles()` process updates the mesh. Fortunately, `setParticles()` calls `updateParticle(particle)` for you.  

If you want to set an initial status, different from the live behavior that you would implement in `SPS.updateParticle(particle)`, you can use `SPS.initParticles()`.  
This function doesn't do anything, you have to implement it.   
It doesn't draw the mesh, it just changes the particle initial status that will be taken in account by the next `SPS.setParticle()` call.
The same thing with SPS.recycleParticle(particle) what is not called automatically and that you have to implement by your own and to call when you need.  
<br/>
<br/>
## Advanced Features
### Create an immutable SPS
You may have to create many similar objects in your scene that won't change afterwards : buildings in the distance, asteroids, scraps, etc. It may thus be useful to use the SPS to set only one mesh in your scene, so one draw call for the rendering.  

You can achieve this by two different ways.  
* You can just build your SPS as explained before and then call just once `setParticles()`, before and outside the render loop, to set your particles where and how you need.  
This method is quite simple. Though, in order to allow you to set the final particle locations, the SPS mesh is built as `updatable` by default. This means its vertex buffer isn't passed once for all to the GPU, but is cached, waiting for a hypothetical further change.  
So this is a simple solution if you don't have many draw calls to handle for the other really moving or changing meshes of your scene.  
Remember also that, if you need to display your SPS in billboard mode, this is the only way to do it and you'll have to call `setParticles()` in the render loop also even if the particles don't move.  

* Else you can build your mesh as non _updatable_.  
Actually the SPS contructor expects a parameter `updatable` what is _true_ by default.  
So, to build a non-updatable mesh, just call explicitly :
```javascript
var SPS = new SolidParticleSystem(name, scene, {updatable: false});
```
As the mesh can't be updated now, `setParticles()` won't have any effect any longer : don't call it, you'll spare some CPU. Actually the `particles` array is not even populated !  
No particle management function called **after** `SPS.buildMesh()` will then have any effect.  
Note that the particles won't move but you can still move, scale or rotate the whole mesh.  

So how to set the initial particle positions, colors, uvs, scales, and so on if the mesh can't be updated ?  

To achieve this, you need to change the mesh at construction time, when adding the shapes.  
You will have to define your own function to set these particle (what don't exist at this time) properties by modifying the way the shapes are added.  
Actually, you can pass to `SPS.addShape()` an exra parameter which is your particle setting function.  
This parameter is an object with the property `positionFunction` to what you will assign your custom function.   
```javascript
SPS.addShape(mesh, nb, {positionFunction: myCustomFunction});
```
Your own function will be called, for a given shape, as many times as the wanted number of particles for this shape. It will be passed two parameters : a _particle_ object and its current position in the total number wanted for this shape.  
So your function must have this kind of signature : 
```javascript
var myBuilder = function(particle, i, s) {
  // particle is the current copy of the shape, the i-th one in the SPS and the s-th one in its shape
};
```
This _particle_ object has the following properties : 

property|type|default
--------|----|-------
position|Vector3|(0,0,0)
rotation|Vector3|(0,0,0)
quaternion|Quaternion|null, if _quaternion_ is set, _rotation_ is ignored
scale|Vector3|(1,1,1)
color|Color4|null
uvs|Vector4|(0,0,1,1)

The expected usage is thus for instance:
```javascript
var myBuilder = function(particle, i, s) {
  // particle is the current particle
  // i is its global index in the SPS
  // s is its index in its shape, so here from 0 to 149
  copy.rotation.y = s / 150;
  copy.position.x = s - 150;
  copy.uvs = new BABYLON.Vector4(0, 0, 0.33, 0.33); // first image from an atlas
  copy.scale.y = Math.random() + 1;
}
var box = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox('b', {}, scene);
var SPS = new BABYLON.SolidParticleSystem('SPS', scene);
SPS.addShape(box, 150, {positionFunction: myBuilder)}; // myBuilder will be called for each of the 150 boxes
var mesh = SPS.buildMesh(false);                       // the mest is not updatable
```
In this former example, each box particle will have its own rotation, position, scale and uvs set once for all at construction time. As the mesh is not updatable, the particles are then not manageable with `setParticles()`.  
You've got here a real immutable mesh. You can still translate it, rotate it, scale it globally as any other mesh until you freeze its World Matrix.  

Note that this feature (modifying the mesh at construction time) is not directly related to the mesh `updatable` parameter. This means you can use it even with a default _updatable_ mesh although it is easier to set the particles the classical war with `setParticles()`.  

**Going further in immutable SPS**  
You've just seen how to modify for ever the SPS mesh at creation time in order to set the particles to your own initial positions, rotations, colors, etc by using the `positionFunction` property with your custom function.  
You can also modify the shape of each particle in the SPS mesh at creation time the same way.  
You will then to use the `vertexPosition` property, just like you used the `positionFunction` property, by defining your own function to set each vertex of each particle from its original value.  
Your function will be then be called once by `SPS.buildMesh()` for each vertex of each particle object as defined in the former part.
```javascript
var myVertexFunction = function(particle, vertex, i) {
  // particle : the current particle
  // vertex : the current vertex, a Vector3
  // i : index of the vertex in the particle shape
  vertex.x *= Math.random() + 1;
};
SPS.addShape(box, 150, {vertexFunction: myVertexFunction}); // the 150 boxes will have their vertices moved randomly
SPS.buildMesh(false);
```
Of course you can use the both properties together :
```javascript
SPS.addShape(box, 150, {vertexFunction: myVertexFunction, positionFunction: myPositionFunction});
```

### Start and End indexes for setParticles()
If you manage a big SPS with dozens of thousands particles, you may want, for performance reasons, not to compute all the new status of all the particles each frame. `setParticles()` expects three optional parameters to help you to choose what to compute or not : `start`, `end`, `update`  

parameter|definition|default value
---------|----------|-------------
start|_(number)_ the index from where to start to iterate in the `particles` array|0
stop|_(number)_ the index (included) where to stop to iterate in the `particles` array|nbParticles - 1
update|_(boolean)_ to force the SPS mesh vertex buffer to be updated|true

If you pass a `end` value greater than `nbParticles` - 1, the iteration will stop anyway at `nbParticles` - 1 to prevent you from trying to access to undefined elements.

Example 1 : you may want to update your 10K particle mesh only every three frames  
* frame 1 : `setParticles(0, 3300, false)` computes everything for particles from 0 to 3300 and doesn't update the mesh.
* frame 2 : `setParticles(3301, 6600, false)` computes everything for particles from 3301 to 6600 and doesn't update the mesh.
* frame 3 : `setParticles(6601, 9999, true)` computes everything for particles from 6601 to 9999 and finally updates the mesh.  

Example 2 : you could keep, say, the first 5000 particles as unused ones and compute the particle behavior only for the 5000 lasts in your global pool.  


### _colors and uvs usages_
_soon_

<br/>
### Update Each Particle Shape
* `SPS.updateParticleVertex()` _usage_ :  
It happens before particle scaling, rotation and translation and it allows to update the vertex coordinates of each particle.   
This function will be called for each vertex of each particle and it will be passed the current particlen the current vertex and its current index in the particle shape.
```javascript
SPS.computeParticleVertex = true; // false by default for performance reason
SPS.updateParticleVertex = function(particle, vertex, v) {
  // particle : the current particle object
  // vertex : the current vertex, a Vector3
  // the index of the current vertex in the particle shape
  // example :
  if (particle.shapeID == 1) {
    vertex.x *= Math.random() + 1;
    vertex.y *= Math.random() + 1;
    vertex.z *= Math.random() + 1;
}
```
Note well that this vertex update is not stored (the particle shape isn't modified) but just computed in the next call to `setParticles()`. So there is no value accumulation : the vertex coordinates are always the initial ones when entering this function.  
Note also that the shape reference for each particle is the original shape of the mesh model you passed in `addShape()`, even if you had passed also a custom `vertexFunction` (see in the part : "Going furhter in immutable SPS").  
The good news is that the very same function can be use for `SPS.updateParticleVertex` and for the custom `vertexFunction` expected by `addShape()`.  
So to better understand how it works, here is another global pseudo-code schema :
```javascript
var particles: SolidParticles[] = [array of SolidParticle objects];
function setParticles() {
  beforeUpdateParticles();                 // your custom function
  for (var p = 0; p < nbParticles; p++) {
    var particle = particles[p];
    updateParticles(particle);             // your custom position function
    for(var v = 0; particle.vertices.length; v++) {
      var vertex = particle.vertices[v];
      updateParticleVertex(particle, vertex, v);   // your ustom vertex function
      computeAllTheVertexStuff();
    }
  }
  updateTheWholeMesh();                   // does the WebGL work
  afterUpdateParticles();                 // your ustom function
}
```
Example : http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1X7SUN#5  

###Pickable Particles
You can set your particles as pickable with the parameter `isPickable` (default _false_) when creating your SPS :
```javascript
var SPS = new BABYLON.SolidParticleSystem('SPS', scene, {isPickable: true});
```
This will set the underlying mesh as pickable and populate an array called `SPS.pickedParticles`. So, don't set your SPS as pickable if you don't need it to be, this will save much memory.  
This array has as many elements as the SPS mesh has many faces and each element is an object with these properties :

* `idx` : the picked particle idx
* `faceId` : the face index of the picked particle (counted within this particle)

Example :
```javascript
var SPS = new BABYLON.SolidParticleSystem('SPS', scene, {isPickable: true});
// add shapes, build the mesh, init particles, etc
SPS.setParticles();                                 // initial SPS draw
SPS.refreshVisibleSize();                           // force the BBox recomputation
scene.onPointerDown = function(evt, pickResult) {
    var meshFaceId = pickResult.faceId;             // get the mesh picked face
    if (faceId == -1) {return;}                     // return if nothing picked
    var idx = SPS.pickedParticles[meshFaceId].idx;  // get the picked particle idx from the pickedParticles array
    var p = SPS.particles[idx];                     // get the picked particle
    p.color.r = 1;                                  // turn it red    
    p.color.b = 0;
    p.color.g = 0;
    p.velocity.y = -1;                              // drop it
    SPS.setParticles();
};
```
The SPS pickability is directly related to the size of its bounding box (please read 'SPS Visibility' part). So, in order to make sure your particles will be pickable, don't forget to force, at last once, the bounding box size recomputation once the particles are set in the space with `setParticles()`.  

###SPS Visibility
To render the meshes on the screen, BJS uses their bounding box (BBox) : if the BBox is in the frustum, then the mesh is selected to be rendered on the screen. This method is really performant as it avoids to make the GPU compute things that wouldn't be visible. The BBox of each mesh is recomputed when its World Martix is updated.    
When you create a SPS, unless you use the `positionFunction` at creation time, all its particles are set by default at the position (0, 0, 0). So the size of the SPS mesh is initially the size of its biggest particle, so it is for its BBox.  
If you animate your particles without updating the SPS mesh World Matrix (ex : the whole SPS doesn't move, rotate or scale), its BBox may keep far more little than the current space occupied by the moving particles. So, if this little BBox gets out of the screen (cam rotation for instance), the whole SPS can then disappear at once !  

In order to manage the SPS visibility, you have two ways : the method `SPS.refreshVisibleSize()` and the property `SPS.isAlwaysVisible` (default _false_); 

* `SPS.refreshVisibleSize()` : updates the SPS mesh BBox size on demand. This is an intensive computation, so it's better not to use it in the render loop each frame. You could call it once the mesh has reached its maximum size for instance. This the method to use if you have a SPS located its in own space somewhere in your scene, like a particle explosion, a fountain, etc.   
*  `SPS.isAlwaysVisible` : if _true_, forces the SPS mesh to be computed by the GPU even if its BBox is not visible. This property is to use when the player evolves inside the SPS (maze, asteroid field) or if the SPS is always bigger than the visible part on the screen. Note that setting it to _true_ doesn't recompute the BBox size, so if you need for some reason (pickability, collisions, etc) to update the BBox, you have to call also at last once `SPS.refreshVisibleSize()`.  


###Garbage Collector Concerns  
In Javascript, the Garbage Collector is usually your friend : it takes care about cleaning up all the not any longer needed variables you could have declared and thus it sets the memory free.  
However, it can sometimes become an awkward friend because it can start its cleaning just while you are displaying a very smooth animation, so it takes the CPU for itself and leaves to you only those nice lags on the screen.  
So the best to do to avoid this GC unpredictable behavior is to keep as low as possible the creation of temporary objects or variables in the render loop.  
As you know now, `updateParticle()` and `updateParticleVertex()` are called each frame for each particle or each particle vertex. 
So imagine that you have a SPS with 30 000 particles. What if you code something like that to simulate some particle acceleration :  
```javascript
SPS.updateParticle = function(particle) {
  var velStep = 0.05;
  particle.velocity += velStep;
  // ...

The _velStep_ temporary variable will be created 30 000 times and then be requested then for collection by the GC !  
So it is better to declare once _velStep_ outside the `udpateParticle()` method.  
The SPS provides to you a way to declare once all your variable needed for it at its own level instead of creating global variables.  
Just use the SPS `vars` property :
```javascript
SPS.vars.velStep = 0.05;
SPS.updateParticle = function(particle) {
  particle.velocity += SPS.vars.velStep;
  // ...
}
```
This will allow you to keep these variables in the SPS object only (and as long as the SPS will exist) and to clean them up gracefully when you will dispose it.  
```javascript
SPS.dispose();  // cleans explicitly all your SPS.vars !
```
A good JS practice for the compiler is to **never** change the variable type once it has been set :
```javascript
SPS.vars.myFloat = 0.01;   // just keep setting float values to myFloat afterwards
SPS.vars.myInt = 5;        // just keep setting integer values to myInt afterwards
SPS.vars.myString = "foo"; // just keep setting string values to myString afterwards
```
